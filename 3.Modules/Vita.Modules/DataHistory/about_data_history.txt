DataHistory module is a simple solution for saving/tracking past versions of an entity. If an entity is registered for history tracking, then for any create/update/delete operation the new (or last, before-delete) state of entity (all data) is saved in a history table. You can retrieve past versions of an entity through IDataHistoryService service. You can retrieve either full history (within period), or entity state at certain date. The past entity state is returned as a string/object dictionary.  
You can register an entity for history tracking either directly through IDataHistoryService, or with [KeepHistory] attribute put on entity.
